# WINNIE KELLEY'S PORTFOLIO

## My live link is https://wk642.github.io/portfolio-website/

## This is a portfolio website is the first step to building my portfolio. So far I used:

###
1. HTML
2. CSS - exploring grid for the first time
3. JavaScript

## The page includes the following:

###
1. Short description about me
2. a nav bar
3. my skills
4. my contact information
5. a contact form that requires name and email
6. Multi pages, does have an about me page, my work page and a upcoming work page.
  - About me page: has a little bit about myself
  - My Work page: a collection of the work I have done so far
  - Upcomign work page: a page where what I am currently working on will live, so others can see my learning journey and even collaborate with me.

## Excited to keep working on this and making it better as I learn new knowledge.
